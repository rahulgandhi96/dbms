Aim:
To write and execute SQL DML (Data Manipulation Language) queries using commands like INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE with operators, functions, and set operators.

 Theory:
DML (Data Manipulation Language) is used to work with data stored in database tables.
It helps to add, change, remove, or view the data.

Common DML commands are:
INSERT → adds new data to a table.
SELECT → retrieves data from a table.
UPDATE → modifies existing data.
DELETE → removes data from a table.
We can also use:

Operators (like >, <, =, AND, OR, LIKE) to filter data.
Functions (like AVG(), COUNT(), SUM()) to perform calculations.
Set Operators (like UNION) to combine results of multiple queries.

 Conclusion:

In this practical, we learned how to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data from a table using DML commands.
We also used conditions, operators, and functions to filter and display data in different ways.
This helped us understand how to manage and handle data in a database effectively.
