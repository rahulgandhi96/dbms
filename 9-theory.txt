MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in the form of documents. It provides powerful tools for data processing, especially the Aggregation Framework and Indexing.

Aggregation in MongoDB:
Aggregation is a process used to analyze and transform documents in a collection. It works like the GROUP BY clause in SQL. MongoDB provides the aggregate() method, which uses different operators to perform operations such as sum, average, minimum, maximum and more.
Common Aggregation Operators

$sum – Adds numeric values in a group
$avg – Calculates average
$min – Finds minimum value
$max – Finds maximum value
$first – Returns first document value
$last – Returns last document value
$push – Stores values in an array
$addToSet – Stores only unique values
$count (using $sum:1) – Counts number of documents

Indexing in MongoDB:Indexing improves the performance of queries. Without indexes, MongoDB must scan every document in a collection to find matching data. This is slow for large collections.
An index stores a smaller, sorted structure of selected fields, which makes searching faster. It works like the index of a book, where topics are listed alphabetically for quick lookup.

Types of Indexes Used

Single Field Index
Example:
db.website1.createIndex({ name: 1 })

Descending Index
Example:
db.website1.createIndex({ name: -1 })

Compound Index
Example:
db.website1.createIndex({ name: 1, r: -1 })


conclusion:Aggregation helps in analyzing and summarizing data stored in collections. It allows grouping and mathematical operations such as sum, average and count.
Indexing improves the speed and efficiency of database queries. It organizes data in a sorted structure, making searches faster.
