Aim : To write SQL DDL statements to create and manage database objects like Table, View, Index, Sequence, and Synonym, and to apply constraints such as Primary Key, Unique, Not Null, and Check.

📘 Theory:

DDL (Data Definition Language) is used to create and modify the structure of a database.
It includes commands like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.

Table: Stores data in rows and columns.

Constraints: Rules like Primary Key, Unique, Not Null, Check to keep data correct.

Index: Makes searching faster.

View: Virtual table made from a SELECT query.

Sequence: Generates numbers automatically (used for IDs).

Synonym: Shortcut name for a table or object.

DDL helps to define and organize the database properly.

✅ Conclusion:

We learned how to use DDL commands to create and manage database objects.
We created a table with constraints, added an index, and made views.
This practical helped us understand how to design the structure of a database and keep data accurate and easy to access.
